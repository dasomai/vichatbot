chatbot can speak vietnamese 


You can chat with it by using Vietnamese 

Remember to create environmenet with python:
python -m venv venv 
venv\Scripts\activate

Then install package:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run:

python vitbot.py 



In the future I want to improve it but talking it with voice 

Using wake word like "Tiểu nhị" or "Thổ địa"

IIt has Speech to text (Vietnamese) and text to speech (Vietnamese)
